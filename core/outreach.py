Hi {name},

We noticed that {company} had previously explored a listing and withdrew. We're working with select high-growth firms in {country} to re-engage capital markets with stronger positioning.

We offer end-to-end listing services including structuring, financing, and underwriting â€” with terms that outperform traditional routes.

Would you be open to a short exploratory call?

Best regards,  
[Your Name]
